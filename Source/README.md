# Fantabode

Fantabode is a Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV that lets you precisely move and place housing items. Nudge furnishings by exact coordinates, bypass normal placement limits and decorate with ease.

## Installation

Fantabode requires the [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

1. Open Dalamud settings in the launcher.
2. In the **Experimental** tab add `https://github.com/LeonBlade/DalamudPlugins` as a third‑party repository.
3. Search for **Fantabode** in the plugin installer and click **Install**.

Please ask for help only from me or on my Discord server.

## Usage

- `/fantabode` – open the main control window. Make sure rotate mode is active.
- `/fantabode list` – display a sortable list of furnishings for interior layouts.

Within the window you can:

- Enable **Place Anywhere** to remove most placement restrictions.
- Toggle **Gizmo** to manipulate the selected object with a three‑axis handle.
- Use **Snap** along with the drag value to move in fixed increments.
- Switch between world and local movement using the image button.
- Drag value boxes or use the +/- buttons to fine‑tune coordinates.
