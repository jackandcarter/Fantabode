# Fantabode

## What is it?
Fantabode is a Dalamud plugin for FFXIV which gives you more control over placing housing items.

## What do I need to run it?
A custom FFXIV launcher capable of running dalamud plugin layer.

## How do I install it?
Currently only developers are able to use the DLL as its still in development.

## How do I use it?
`/fantabode` brings up the window to move items around. You **MUST** be in rotate mode for it to work.

Enabling the "Place Anywhere" checkbox will remove restrictions on placing items down for most cases.

Enabling the "Gizmo" checkbox will give you access to a movement tool in game to manipulate the selected object on all three axis.

Enabling the "Snap" checkbox will lock your gizmo movements to the interval defined in the "drag" box at the bottom.

Clicking on the image button will change the movement mode to world and local movement.

Click and drag on the boxes to change their values based on the drag input, alternatively, use the + and - buttons on the other inputs to adjust by the drag value as well. You can also enter numbers in here if you like by typing them.

`/fantabode list` opens a furnishing list used for indoors. Allows you to sort objects by distance to refine the list of items.


Additional features include multi-item selection and group placement preview, upon confirming the placement each item is place in sequence. Fantabode also re-imagines BDTH UI with additional tabs and options.

## Final message
Thank you to LeonBlade for inspiring the creation of this plugin. Fantabode is the continuation of a special BDTH fork and has been redesigned with a fresh UI and additional options and API logic.
