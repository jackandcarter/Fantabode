## How do I use it?
`/bdth` brings up the window to move items around. You **MUST** be in rotate mode for it to work.

Enabling the "Place Anywhere" checkbox will remove restrictions on placing items down for most cases.

Enabling the "Gizmo" checkbox will give you access to a movement tool in game to manipulate the selected object on all three axis.

Enabling the "Snap" checkbox will lock your gizmo movements to the interval defined in the "drag" box at the bottom.

Clicking on the image button will change the movement mode to world and local movement.

Click and drag on the boxes to change their values based on the drag input, alternatively, use the + and - buttons on the other inputs to adjust by the drag value as well. You can also enter numbers in here if you like by typing them.

`/bdth list` opens a furnishing list used for indoors. Allows you to sort objects by distance to refine the list of items in item dense house.
